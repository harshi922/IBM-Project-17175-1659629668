A Gesture-based Tool for Sterile Browsing of Radiology Images
## Problem Statement 
The use of doctor-computer interaction devices in the operation room requires new modalities that support medical imaging manipulation while allowing doctors’ hands to remain sterile, supporting their focus of attention, and providing fast response times. Therefore, a gesture recognition system that interprets user’s gestures for manipulation of medical images is proposed.
## Social Impact/ Customer Satisfaction
The ability to interact through patient medical images in a sterile format augments the attention of the surgeon towards surgery. The surgeon need not change location in order to browse images, but can do it remotely. Further, inconveniences caused in physical interaction, being possible mode for infection spread, is now solved.
## Scalability of the Solution
Numerous hospitals in the present date, follow only physical mode of interaction with images during surgery. But the need for sterile browsing in intact and vital. This explains that the model has immense scope to be scaled and distributed among various surgeons. Additionally, the model can be improvised to perform more functions than interactions, such as automatic and consecutive fetching of related images, ex. If an image of shoulder blade inspected, more likely hand will also be inspected.
